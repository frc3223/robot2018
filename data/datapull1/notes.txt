from elevator4.py, I get velocity at 100% voltage to be around
11080 encoder ticks per second, which translates to
17 rad/sec
need to read motor resistances again, grr
one of them was drawing between 11 and 12 amps, another between 13 and 14.
current seemed to increase slightly as elevator went up
all with 10.5 volts. I think battery was a bit low, base was 12.3

say 12 amps per motor. what is the torque per motor?
Kt = 


what dreck is the above?
from elevator2.csv, I get 

10.3 V -> 13500 enc/sec

from elevator4.csv, I get
7.1 V -> 9900 enc/sec

for these, I hope the elevator is going up, but I think they aren't.

from elevator3.csv, I get

10.6 V -> 11700 enc/sec
